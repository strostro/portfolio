  <h2>Report Summary: Economic Downturn and Child Poverty in New Zealand</h2>

  <h3>1. Research Focus</h3>
  <p>This report explores New Zealand's socio-economic data. Based on initial findings, it focuses on how the economic downturn has affected child well-being—particularly poverty.</p>

  <h3>2. Overview of Analytical Workflow</h3>

  <h3>3. Summary of Key Findings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The higher the unemployment, the more children fall into poverty—this is true across all poverty levels.</li>
    <li>Children in the poorest households (40% threshold) are consistently affected when unemployment rises.</li>
    <li>In families closer to the poverty line (50% and 60%), the connection between job loss and child poverty goes up and down more, likely affected by external factors such as policy, economic shifts, or support programs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Key Findings</h3>
  <h4>Long-Term Unemployment and Child Poverty</h4>
  <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> How does long-term unemployment influence child poverty across different poverty thresholds?</p>
  <p>Lagged correlation analysis was conducted between the long-term unemployment rate and child poverty rates under three poverty thresholds (40%, 50%, 60% of median income):</p>

  <p><strong>Key Insights</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Positive correlation: Child poverty increases as long-term unemployment rises, across all poverty thresholds.</li>
    <li>Deeper poverty is more sensitive: The lower the poverty threshold, the stronger the correlation.</li>
    <li>Interpretation: Economic shocks affect the poorest families most severely, increasing the likelihood of children falling into deep poverty.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Temporal Trends in Correlation</h4>
  <p><strong>Research Question:</strong> How does the correlation between the long-term unemployment rate and the three child poverty rates vary over time?</p>
  <p><strong>Key Insights</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The 40% poverty line shows a stable and strong correlation with long-term unemployment.<br>→ Suggests that children in deep poverty are consistently affected by unemployment, with fewer external disruptions.</li>
    <li>Correlations for the 50% and 60% poverty lines fluctuate more, possibly due to various external factors such as policy, economic shifts, or support programs.</li>
    <li>In short: When the economy worsens, children in the deepest poverty are the most reliably and persistently affected.</li>
